//Theory

map : is a object like structure of keys and value but allows store key of any type 
--> key should be unique other wise it will be replace the previouse value of that key
--map returns a map object
-- map.set() returns the map object so chaning is possible.
-- methods : set(),get(),delete(),has(),map.values(),map.keys()
**Set()
--> set is unique collection of values the structure is same as array but store uniuq value
-->set returns a set object
--> methods : add(),clear(),delete(),has()

set and map questions : 
🧠 How would you implement a caching mechanism using Map?

📊 Given an array of strings, write a program to count the frequency of each word using Map.

🔁 Convert a Map to an object and vice versa.

🕵️‍♂️ Can you store NaN in a Set? What happens if you add NaN multiple times?

🔄 How does Map maintain insertion order and why is that useful?

❌ What are the common pitfalls of using objects as keys in a plain object vs. a Map?

🧪 Write a function that compares two Sets for equality.
